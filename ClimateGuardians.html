        <h2>Climate Guardians</h2>

        <p>In October of 2020 we set out on our research journey with the goal of learning more about climate change and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO is a climate phenomena caused by changes in permanent regions of high and low air pressure in the North Atlantic. The high pressure region is located over Portugal and the low pressure region is located over Iceland. Air pressure is the amount of force exerted by the weight of air on Earthâ€™s surface. A strong NAO occurs when there is a big difference between the high and low pressure regions. This can impact climate in the North Atlantic with North America and Europe experiencing warmer and wetter winters during a strong NAO. To study the impact of the NAO on the ocean, we analyzed sea surface temperature data over the past 200 years to visualize how temperature during strong periods of the NAO has changed. By looking at this long record, we also hope to understand if this influence of the NAO has been altered by climate change.</p>
