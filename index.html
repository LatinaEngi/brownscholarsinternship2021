        <h1>BridgeUP: STEM - Brown Scholars Internship</h1>
        <h2>September 2020 - June 2021</h2>

  <main>
    <p>Brown Scholars is an intensive program for high school girls, focused on the intersection of computer science and science. It is part of BridgeUP: STEM, the newest education program at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. <a href="https://www.amnh.org/learn-teach/bridgeup-stem">Learn more here</a></p>
    
    <h2>Brown Scholars Interns</h2>

    <p>During the first year of the program, Brown Scholars learn Python and coding for computational science. Afterwards we continue developing our coding skills and technical knowledge as part of a paid internship at the Museum.</p>

        <p>In October of 2020 we set out on our research journey with the goal of learning more about climate change and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO is a climate phenomena caused by changes in permanent regions of high and low air pressure in the North Atlantic. The high pressure region is located over Portugal and the low pressure region is located over Iceland. Air pressure is the amount of force exerted by the weight of air on Earth’s surface. A strong NAO occurs when there is a big difference between the high and low pressure regions. This can impact climate in the North Atlantic with North America and Europe experiencing warmer and wetter winters during a strong NAO. To study the impact of the NAO on the ocean, we analyzed sea surface temperature data over the past 200 years to visualize how temperature during strong periods of the NAO has changed. By looking at this long record, we also hope to understand if this influence of the NAO has been altered by climate change.</p>

        <p>Throughout the course of this project, the COVIDebuggers studied epidemiology during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the past year, people have been encouraged to "listen to the science" and to follow new restrictions that may constantly be changing. The COVIDebuggers studied the causes of health outcomes in the United States and how infection may spread across different populations.  The interns used the Python library, Plotly, to create animated visualizations based on time series data acquired by the New York Times, John Hopkins University and Our World In Data GitHub repositories. They also learned about artificial intelligence, implementing the machine learning tool, Prophet, using it to create prediction models on several COVID-19 related datasets to ultimately predict the date at which COVID-19 restrictions would be lifted. To help society better understand the virus and encourage healthy habits, they developed a chatbot that can interact with the user by learning how to maneuver the Natural Language Processing API, IBM Watson Assistant. Finally, the students applied web development concepts to incorporate all of the above listed work onto a website for public use to combat misinformation, which has been prevalent during this pandemic!</p>

        <p>In the year 2020, our climate crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic had many feeling the need to escape - but to where? During the Escape Earth Experience, we searched for exoplanets orbiting stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We found 8 exoplanet candidates, 3 of which were previously unknown. TESS is an all-sky survey optimized for finding exoplanets, and it has observed > ½ million stars at a 2-minute cadence. Each star’s data is called a light curve, which is multiple measurements of the star’s brightness over a period of time. When an orbiting object crosses in front of its star there is a brief periodic reduction in the star’s measured brightness called a transit. However, this method can’t detect all possible planet transits because of how limited our view is. We can only observe transits of exoplanets whose orbital planes are aligned with our line of sight. For our project we selected 40,000 light curves from two sectors of observation, representing 27,906 stars, to search for transit signals in the data. We created a GitHub hosted library of tools written in Python to clean, analyze, and visualize the light curves and the transits we found. To find exoplanets we first reduced our sample size by implementing a temperature and magnitude cut to isolate main sequence stars. Then we wrote code for a Box-Least Squares (BLS) analysis that searches for transit signals. Using a combination of thresholds in BLS values we selected stellar candidates with the strongest transit signals. Finally, we visually inspected each star’s light curves, BLS statistics and used the BLS values to calculate the transiting object’s radius in order to remove objects too large to be exoplanets, such as binary stars. The estimated radii of our newly discovered exoplanet candidates measured 12, 24, & 11 Earth radii. These are very large and are likely Hot Jupiters, Brown Dwarf Stars, or Gas Giant Planets, therefore further study is needed to characterize these new worlds. Searching for exoplanets as small as Earth is a difficult task, as our project has shown, but we have gained skills and added programming tools that can assist in the ongoing search for Earth’s Plan(et) B.</p>

        <p>We investigated the impact of repetitive protein sequences on the function of spider silk. Spiders create many different types of silk, each of which to serve a different purpose. The silks abilities are based on the genetic information of the protein that makes up spider silk. To better understand the structure function, the students created a script in Python to search through spider silk protein data, isolate these repeat units and organize them in a way that explains their relation to one another (between species as well as protein/silk type).

        <a href="">20 Years of Ocean Velocities</a>
        <p>We created a weekly dataset of vertical ocean velocities of the North Atlantic Ocean for the past 20 years. This data is useful for oceanographers who study eddies, which are large, cyclical storms in the ocean characterized by strong vertical velocities. To create this dataset, we wrote code in python that created needed input files for code written in fortran, and ran the fortran code using a shell script. We visualized the dataset we created by creating hovmoller diagrams, which allow us to see information in time and space. We also learned about machine learning, which will be used by scientist in the future with our dataset to predict eddies in the future.</p>

        <a href="">From Python to Javascript</a>
        <p>For the past nine months we have been leveraging our knowledge of Python and coding to learn Javascript, HTML, and CSS. We also learned about API's and used this knowledge to build our own Slack App.</p>
